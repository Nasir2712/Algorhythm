# Algorhythm

A playlist browser application that have multiple views on main controller. By using tapping gestures on this views and using segues with the help of navigation controllers we can navigate to a detail view controller which displays a detail view of clicked playlist.
This application was made in Objective-C for iOS application.
The application was made to enhance my roots in Objective-C by learning how to pass data through navigation controller and without using Collection and table views that come inbuilt with iOS.
In order to check this application please clone this repo on your machine and open xcode project to run it on the Xcode Simulator without any bugs.
